                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ready Player One, by Ernest Cline, is a novel that takes place in the future where the OASIS, a virtual reality system, is part of people’s everyday life. In the book, the creator of the OASIS creates a contest where the winner gets everything he owns. Throughout the book, the main character, Wade Watts, works his way up to win the contest. This novel should be more high school English classes because the book is similar to 1984, relatable to students, and the novel’s allusions educate the readers about the 80’s pop culture.</p>
                    
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ready Player One is an updated version of 1984, by George Orwell. Similar to 1984, Ready Play One is set in a dystopian society. The only difference is the technology, and the date. In the novel, the main character lives in the “stacks”. The stacks are a bunch of mobile homes stacked on top of each other (Cline 21). Living in these homes would be awful. The only reason this can happen is because there isn’t enough land to put homes side by side. Each neighborhood would be like New York, but more run down and dirty. On top of that, poverty in the country flourished, and crime happened often (Cline 16-18).</p>
                    
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The novel also has aspects of life that is relatable to students. Since the book came out in the 21st century, the language used in the book is easily understood by students. In the beginning of the book, Wade and his friend, Aech, had a conversation before school.</p>

                <p>This sample was made for my english class at CART. This sample is part of a timed essay that I did recently. The prompt was to explain why, or why not, Ready Player One should be more widely read in school. This is formatted in MLA.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the year of 2090, and the world hasn’t changed much since 2016. The only thing new is the IPhone 20. The shootings, the feminists, the racists, everything is still the same. The government is still not doing anything about these topics people seem to talk about. Other than that, Sashimi is just enjoying the cool weather in San Diego, California.</p>
                    
	                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike anywhere else in the country, San Diego is the only place that is nice. The weather here is great! The nice blue sky that is always hovering over the city gives everybody a good smile on their face. The nice hills are always fun to go over, and the pollution is way under the level it was at when it was 2040. There are always the sweet clear blue sea that the beach has. Everywhere else is just filled with pollution, and it’s just straight up ugly. Due to this, the government restricted everybody from leaving, or entering the city. The only way to enter the city is from Los Angeles since that place isn’t that bad.</p>
	                
	                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sashimi is in the car, singing to “Name of Love” by Martin Garrix, on the way to the Zion Market. When he got there, his good friend Jun coincidently parked next to him. Jun gets out of the car and says, “Hey Sash!”. Sashimi comes out to shake Jun’s hand and greet him. As they walk in, the two began to chat more. “What are you here for?” asks Jun. Sashimi replies, “I’m here to get some kimchi, rice, and some ramen. Probably some other food that appeals to me. Hows life going?” Jun says, ”It’s going great! I finally got that raise I’ve been needing, and with that money, I’ll be getting the new computer I’ve been dying for.” “Wow! That’s cool! I’m still waiting for my parts to ship. I ordered them from Virginia, but they never shipped”, says Sashimi. Jun says, ”Wow. That sucks. You should call them for a refund.” Sashimi replies, “I already tried calling them. The problem is that when I tried calling them, the line cut off. Well, I got all of my stuff now. See you later.” </p>

                <p>This is a made up story that I did in my Sophomore year of highschool. I had to create a story that has a totalitarian aspects to it. I chose this because it’s one of the few creative writings that I’ve done.</p>
