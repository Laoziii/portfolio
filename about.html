                Hi! If you didn't already know, I am Ryan Vatsana Thipavong. Currently, I am a student at Clovis East High School, and the Center for Advanced Research and Technology. I was born in Chicago, Illinois, then I moved around the country a bit until I ended up in Fresno, California.

                As of now, I have no experience in the workforce, but I have done a good amount of projects in school. One of the projects that I have been part of at CART is our Digital Ethics website. The whole class was split up into groups, and each group had a subject to work on for the project. The group that I was in had the subject of conscious creators of content and digital footprints. At first, our group of five split up the research by taking notes on each subtopic. After we’ve finished taking notes, we compiled them to be smaller, and more effective to be put into the content of our website. When the content gathering was done, we worked on the programing of the website. Three people, including me, worked on the programming of the website while the other two people worked on spelling and grammar checks. The outcome of this was a fully functional website where people can obtain information about Digital Ethics. We made this website to bring awareness to Digital Ethics because there are people out where who don’t aren’t really conscious about what they do on the Internet.

                In my spare time, I like to do many things. The things I do the most are singing, cooking, and playing video games. I love singing; I do it every day. I sing genres ranging from pop, to RnB, to foreign music. Any song that I find enjoyable is something that I sing. Another hobby that I enjoy a lot is cooking. If you know how to cook, you can create many things that are wonderful to eat. I’m still learning a lot of techniques and recipes, but I just absolutely enjoy the process of cooking food, and sharing it with friends and family. When they enjoy the meal, I know that I’ve done a good job. Lastly, one of my favorite hobbies is playing video games. I usually play video games when I have absolutely nothing to do. It’s just something that I can do to pass time. Some of my favorite games are Stardew Valley, and Black Desert Online. I have other interests, but I feel like if I keep going on, this section might never end.
